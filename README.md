# Abacus
C++ program

This is the 4th coding project I completed in the short history of my programming career

New skills used to build this program:
  functions
  arrays

Program builds on past skills:
  loops
  math
  cin
  cout

The purpose of this project was to learn to use functions outside of the main body of the program and to manipulate and manage arrays.
The main body of the program only contains two lines of code. The two other functions control the rest of the program. 
  Two functions are declared at the start of the program.
    The first function intakes 10 integers from the user and stores them in array.
      The integers in the array are repeated back to the user. 
      The integers are then sorted and the highest and lowest number are reported to the user.
        Sample output: 
          1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 
          The lowest number entered: 1
          The highest number entered: 10
    The second function intakes 20 integes from the user and stores the first 10 in an array and the second 10 in a seperate array.
      The integers in both arrays are repeated back to the user.
      The program add the integers in the first array to the corrosponding integers in the second array.
      The program multiplies the integers in the first array to the corrosponding integes in the second array.
        Sample output:
             1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,   7,   8,   9,  10
            11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,  17,  18,  19,  20 
            12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 22,  24,  26,  28,  30 sums
            11, 24, 39, 56, 75, 96, 119, 144, 171, 200 products
